### Key Details
- Make sure your leg is as flush with the neck as possible. (there are different adjustments you can do to tighten your leg up if its loose)

- Flex your feet and your toes up

- Point the knee of your non choking leg towards your opponents head, (Further pushing their arm into their carotid)

- Pull your opponents head down for increased pressure on both sides(For kids pull the knee on your choking leg)

- Cutting the angle of your body to the same side of your leg that's over the opponents arm, also increases pressure

- Under hooking your opponents leg with your arm is an intuitive way to cut your angle and at the same time prevent your opponent from picking you up off the ground and slamming you.
