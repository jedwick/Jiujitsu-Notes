If you're new to jiujitsu and trying to learn as much as possible, that's great! but try not to learn everything at once, its more efficient to set small attainable goals, e.g. get to side control and just hold it for 1 minute, or get the proper grips to execute a move, even if you can't finish it you accomplished the first step of the move in a live roll!


Drilling moves to completion.
Especially important when it comes to sweeps, if you stay on the ground you're building bad habits. And additionally you're wasting drilling potential by not using the moment your training partner falls down to come up. A lot of moves are easy to reset and drill a lot of reps, but resetting the moment of someone falling down from a sweep is probably the most time consuming component of any type of move, so don't waste that moment.


Show as many details as possible, but make sure you show them in order of importance.

Push Pull
Is a great way to be more ambiguous with what you're trying to do, as well as baiting your opponent to react in a way you want them to, most of the time anyway.
