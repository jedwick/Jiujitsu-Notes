Hello and welcome to my little jiujitsu note project!
I think before diving into all the moves and looking at the small details, its important to keep in mind that when it comes to most things in life, not just BJJ moves, there isn't a 100% right way to do something, most of the time it depends...

So if you see a detail/move that got you guard passed or subbed or "insert negative outcome here" Please try to keep an open mind about the benefits of the "detail/move" and either provide an alternative detail/move with a description or a pros/cons of the previous detail/move.
Thank you!

Also if you want to contribute here's some default key binds for obsidian that are pretty useful!
