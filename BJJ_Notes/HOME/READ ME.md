Hello and welcome to my little jiujitsu note project!
I think before diving into all the moves and looking at the small details, its important to keep in mind that when it comes to most things in life, not just BJJ, there isn't a 100% right way to do something, most of the time it depends...

That said i think there's a fine line between small details that have pros and cons and moves that straight up don't work on a resisting opponent. So with that out of the way, i look forward to reading your commits!

Feel free to change [[Current Focus]] in your local copy to whatever you're currently working on!

For faster navigation you can press Ctrl + O to bring up the quick switcher and type in whatever you're looking for.

Also if you want to contribute here's some default key binds for obsidian that are pretty useful!
